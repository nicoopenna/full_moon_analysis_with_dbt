# full_moon_analysis_with_dbt

This repository was created as part of a personal course to showcase hands-on skills with dbt (data build tool). It demonstrates how to build, test, and document data models using dbt in a real-world project structure.

## About

The content of this repository is designed to reflect practical experience with dbt, from project setup to model deployment. It serves as a portfolio piece for demonstrating proficiency with dbt and modern analytics engineering workflows.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nicoopenna/dbt-course.git
   cd dbt-course
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   If a `requirements.txt` file is present, install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Explore the dbt project:**
   The main dbt project files are located in the `dbtlearn/` directory. Here you'll find models, configuration, and example workflows.

## Project Structure

- `dbtlearn/` — Main dbt project with models, seeds, macros, and configurations.
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies for working with dbt (if available).
- `.gitignore` — Standard git ignore rules.

## Usage

Use this repository as a reference for:
- Setting up a dbt project from scratch
- Creating and organizing models
- Implementing tests and documentation in dbt
- Demonstrating analytics engineering best practices
